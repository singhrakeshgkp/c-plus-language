# OOPS
## Structs
- refer ```StrutsEx1.cpp```

## class
- refer ```ClassEx1.cpp```
- **Constructor And Desctructor** refer ```CassEx2.cpp```
- **Encapsulation** add getter and setter method.
-  **Static Data member** refer ```ClassEx3.cpp``` we can not initialize static data member variable inside class, we have to initialize outside class.
-  **Operator Overloading**  refer ```OperatorOverloadingEx1.cpp```
-  **Overloading Insert and Extraction operator** ```OperatorOverloadingEx2.cpp```
-  **Friend Functions and Operator Overloading** ```FriendFunEx1.cpp``` can be used to acess private data member of a call.
## Using Class From Multiple Files
- create ```Employee.cpp, Employee.h and main.cpp file``` copy employee class and methods from ```FriendFunEx1.cpp``` class. Compline and run it should produce same result as ```FirnedFunEx1.cpp```
